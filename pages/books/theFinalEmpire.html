        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a
          thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a
          thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with
          absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when
          hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly
          scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the
          Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier "snapped" and found in
          himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural
          leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord
          Ruler himself as the mark.
          <br />
          <br />
          Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most
          trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers,
          and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals
          his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the
          downfall of the divine despot.
          <br />
          <br />
          But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks
          more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl
          named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's
          lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from
          everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her
          master powers of which she never dreamed.
