        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Born on the wrong side of the sheets, Fitz, son of Chivalry Farseer,
          is a royal bastard, cast out into the world, friendless and lonely.
          Only his magical link with animals - the old art known as the Wit -
          gives him solace and companionship. But the Wit, if used too often, is
          a perilous magic, and one abhorred by the nobility. So when Fitz is
          finally adopted into the royal household, he must give up his old ways
          and embrace a new life of weaponry, scribing, courtly manners; and how
          to kill a man secretly, as he trains to become a royal assassin.
