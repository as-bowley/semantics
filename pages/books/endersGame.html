        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war
          games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The
          result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius
          Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to
          destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender
          into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside,
          or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins.
          He will grow up fast.
          <br />
          <br />
          But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the
          Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the
          perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older
          siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but
          in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent,
          Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether.
          Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are
          driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for
          power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a
          ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of
          the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing
          essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the
          computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the
          destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother
          Ender fails.
