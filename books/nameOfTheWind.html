        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The tale of Kvothe, from his childhood in a troupe of traveling
          players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled
          city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult
          and dangerous school of magic. In these pages, you will come to know
          Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful
          musician, and an infamous assassin. But this book is so much more, for
          the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.
